# TRACE_DATA_PREPERATION
The ISIC 2019 dataset was used to separate hairy and non-hairy dermoscopic images. Hair artifacts were removed using computer vision techniques, then merged back with clean images. All images were resized to 720×720 resolution, and data augmentation was applied to handle class imbalance.
